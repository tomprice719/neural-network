A simple feedforward neural network for recognizing handwritten digits, implemented "from scratch" as an exercise (I use a library for the basic linear algebra operations but made my own implementation of backpropogation / inference). It can also generate "dream" digits by using gradient descent to find an input that maximizes a particular digit probability in the output layer.

This requires the training and test csv files from here: http://www.pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/
Put them in the resources folder.
